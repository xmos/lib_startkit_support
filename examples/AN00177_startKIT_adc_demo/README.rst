A startKIT ADC demo
===================

.. version:: 1.0.0

Summary
-------

This applications provides a very simple example of using the ADC
module.  It uses the on-chip ADC in one shot mode (a trigger is called every
200ms from a timer) and then reads the 4 values after conversion
complete notification received. It also shows an example of a select
(wait on multiple events) because it also listens to the button, and
lights additional LEDs when that is pressed.
